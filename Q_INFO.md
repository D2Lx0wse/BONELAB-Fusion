# Quest Support

Limitations
- You can't speak in voice chat, but you can receive it
- Steam Friend lobbies don't have their own menu, I was just lazy honestly
- Performance, obviously. I recommend not having more than two other people but you can push it all you want

Requirements
- A PC
  - Does not need to be powerful, as long as it runs Steam it will work
  - Currently only Windows is supported, but if a Mac users wants to be my test dummy then I'll try
- An updated Lemon install
